## Prologue
This is my personal configuration (dot) files of all the programs i use on a daily based on *GNU/Linux* which system distribution called *Arch Linux*. a little bit shit reason, I don't know why i picked up Arch as daily operating system, but in the fact i admit it if the user repository aka AUR has a lot of nice softwares or programs offers, provides to a user. and yeah some little shit challenge should i do when trying to install this one. I made this setup as comfortable and stable as possible for myself, and maybe for those of you that want to use it.

Here's the components of my setup.

a small bit shit, i got blackarch repo installed in my machine. <br/>
i will tell you how i did the installation.

just follow this step..
```sh
$ curl -O https://blackarch.org/strap.sh
$ chmod +x strap.sh
$ ./strap.sh
```
if you got some trouble after installation like, keyring error or something like that, idk i was forget lol.
follow this step again.
```
# pacman-key --init
# pacman-key --populate
# pacman-key --refresh-keys
# pacman -Syyu
```
or if that step didnt work. you can add this `Server = https://blackarch.org/` at the bottom of your mirrorlist file `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`.
after that, run this command `pacman -Syy`. done.

To check the blackarch repo installed in your machine do this command
```
$ pacman -Sgg | grep blackarch
```
