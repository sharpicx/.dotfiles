## Prologue
This is my personal configuration (dot) files of all the programs i use on a daily based on *GNU/Linux* which system distribution called *Arch Linux*. a little bit shit reason, I don't know why i picked up Arch as daily operating system, but in the fact i admit it if the user repository aka AUR has a lot of nice softwares or programs offers, provides to a user. and yeah some little shit challenge should i do when trying to install this one. I made this setup as comfortable and stable as possible for myself, and maybe for those of you that want to use it.

Here's the components of my setup.
